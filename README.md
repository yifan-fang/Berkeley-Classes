## Projects description
### Stat 133 Concepts in Computaing with Data
- Stat 133 Proj1: Created an animated graph that shows the tragectories of the storms.
- Stat 133 Proj2: A shinyapp for savings rate calculator.

### Data C100 Principles & Techniques of Data Science
- Data C100 Proj1: This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing data set that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois. 
- Part A includes basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), adding a few new features to the dataset, and data cleaning as well. 
- Part B fits a linear model for the purpose of prediction, analyzed the error of the model, and brainstormed ways to improve the model's performance.
### CS 61B Data Structures
- Project 2 builds the back end of a browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts, accepting input and generating appropriate output for display.
